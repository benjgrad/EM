# Decision Authority Matrix: Empowering Teams Within Boundaries

## Overview

Clear decision boundaries enable autonomy while maintaining alignment. This matrix defines who has authority for different types of decisions, reducing bottlenecks and empowering teams to move quickly on tactical choices.

## Authority Levels Defined

- **✅ Decide**: Has full authority to make the decision
- **🤝 Co-lead**: Shares decision-making authority, must collaborate
- **💬 Consult**: Must be consulted before decision is made
- **📢 Inform**: Must be informed after decision is made
- **❌ No Role**: Not involved in this decision type

## Decision Escalation Framework

### When to Escalate

**Immediate Escalation Required:**
- Decisions affecting multiple teams
- Budget implications > $10K
- Security or compliance concerns
- Architectural changes affecting system stability

**Consultation Required:**
- Decisions outside your authority level
- Uncertain about decision boundaries
- Potential impact on other team members
- Customer-facing changes

**No Escalation Needed:**
- Decisions within your authority
- Tactical implementation choices
- Process improvements within team
- Individual productivity optimizations

## Common Decision Scenarios

### Scenario 1: UI Component Implementation
**Situation:** Developer needs to implement a new form component
**Authority:** Senior Developer can decide implementation approach
**Required Consultation:** Designer for visual specifications, QA for validation approach
**Documentation:** Brief implementation notes in code comments

### Scenario 2: Database Schema Change
**Situation:** Feature requires new database tables
**Authority:** Tech Lead decides schema design
**Required Consultation:** Product Manager for business requirements, QA for testing implications
**Documentation:** Schema change documentation and migration plan

### Scenario 3: Feature Scope Adjustment
**Situation:** Technical complexity discovered during implementation
**Authority:** Product Manager decides scope changes
**Required Consultation:** Tech Lead for technical implications, QA for quality impact
**Documentation:** Updated requirements and impact assessment

### Scenario 4: Quality Standards Definition
**Situation:** New feature type requires quality criteria
**Authority:** QA Analyst defines quality standards
**Required Consultation:** Product Manager for business requirements, Tech Lead for technical feasibility
**Documentation:** Quality criteria added to team standards

## Implementation Tips

### Getting Started
1. **Print and Post**: Make matrix visible to entire team
2. **Practice Scenarios**: Walk through common decisions as team
3. **Start Small**: Begin with low-risk decisions to build confidence
4. **Regular Review**: Adjust matrix based on real-world usage

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Over-consulting**: Don't consult when you have clear authority
- **Under-consulting**: Don't skip required consultations to save time
- **Authority Creep**: Don't expand your authority without team agreement
- **Decision Paralysis**: Don't avoid decisions due to unclear boundaries
