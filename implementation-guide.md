## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### High-Risk Scenarios and Responses

**Risk: Management reverts to control measures under pressure**
- **Mitigation**: Establish outcome-based success stories early
- **Response Plan**: Create executive dashboard showing business impact
- **Escalation**: Have change champions ready with data

**Risk: Teams struggle with increased autonomy**
- **Mitigation**: Gradual authority transfer with coaching
- **Response Plan**: Provide decision-making frameworks and support
- **Escalation**: Temporary return to structured approach for struggling individuals

**Risk: Quality concerns arise from looser specifications**
- **Mitigation**: Implement continuous quality validation
- **Response Plan**: Focus on outcome-based quality metrics
- **Escalation**: Enhanced QA partnership and risk-based testing

**Risk: Estimation accuracy decreases initially**
- **Mitigation**: Expect and communicate initial accuracy dip
- **Response Plan**: Focus on confidence intervals and learning
- **Escalation**: Provide additional estimation training
